                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  To start setting up your bot after you obtain your key, go to the discord server and use the /redeem command. This command allows you to redeem your key. 
                  Next you will need to make your own discord bot by going to https://discord.com/developers/applications and hitting the new application button. 
                  Now that you have your application you will need to go to the bot tab and enable all "Privileged Gateway Intents"
                  Next you can hit reset my bot token, once you have reset your bot's token make sure to save that somewhere safe and do not share that.
                  Now you can go back to the discord server and do the /create command. you can input your bot's token that you saved and get your discord id by right clicking on your profile (hint: to get your discord id you need developer mode turned on, it's in settings under advanced)
                  Now once you have done that your bot is almost finished, go back to the developer portal and use the OAuth2 tab to invite your bot to your server with bot and admin selected.
                  Congrats! you have now setup the bot and invited it to your server, now you can follow the rest of the tutorial to

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  Nice job! you finished making your bot, now let's get the vouches rolling in. First you will have to use the /configure command, and set your vouches channel, and your customer role. This command is pretty self-explanatory but don't worry if you need any help, please open a support ticket in our discord server.
                  Once you have set that up you are all done, but let's have some fun configuring this thing! The biggest thing you can do is change your bot's pfp and name by going to the developer portal and just changing the pfp and name! Next you can change your embeds however you want, use the /configure command then hit edit embed, then you can edit the Title, the Description, and the Color all through this one command. If you would like it to say something like this is vouch number 31, you can hit edit description and use the vouch_count variable. I will list all the variables below.
